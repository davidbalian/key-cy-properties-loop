# AJAX Infinite Loading Fix

## Issue

AJAX requests were hanging indefinitely when filtering properties, showing "[KCPF] Sending AJAX request..." but never receiving a response.

## Root Cause

The AJAX handler had several issues:

1. Manual `header()` calls interfering with WordPress's built-in AJAX handling
2. Output buffering was being handled incorrectly
3. No timeout on AJAX requests
4. Insufficient error handling and logging

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed AJAX Handler (`key-cy-properties-filter.php`)

- Removed manual `header('Content-Type: application/json')` - WordPress handles this automatically
- Removed problematic `ob_start()` and `ob_end_clean()` calls that were causing conflicts
- Added `@ob_clean()` to ensure clean output buffer before sending response
- Added comprehensive error logging with timestamps
- Simplified error handling flow

### 2. Enhanced JavaScript (`assets/js/filters.js`)

- Added 30-second timeout to AJAX requests
- Added timestamp logging for debugging
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- Added error display for timeout and other AJAX failures

### 3. Version Update

- Updated plugin version from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2

## Testing

1. Clear browser cache to ensure new JavaScript is loaded
2. Submit a filter form and check console for logs
3. Verify that AJAX request completes within 30 seconds
4. Check server error logs for `[KCPF]` prefixed messages

## Expected Behavior

- AJAX requests should complete successfully
- Console should show "AJAX response received" message
- Properties should update without page reload
- If there's an error, a timeout message should appear after 30 seconds

## Debugging

If issues persist:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Check server error logs for `[KCPF]` logs
3. Verify AJAX URL is correct in console logs
4. Ensure WordPress debug is enabled to catch PHP errors
